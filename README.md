The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's designed to improve focus and productivity by breaking work into intervals, traditionally **25 minutes** long, separated by **short breaks**. These intervals are known as **"Pomodoros"**, named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a student.

### How It Works:

1. **Choose a task** you want to work on.
2. **Set a timer for 25 minutes** (one Pomodoro).
3. **Work on the task** without interruptions until the timer rings.
4. **Take a 5-minute break** to rest your mind.
5. After completing **four Pomodoros**, take a **longer break** (15â€“30 minutes).

### Why It Helps with Focus:

* **Reduces mental fatigue:** Frequent breaks help your brain stay fresh and avoid burnout.
* **Increases accountability:** The ticking timer creates a sense of urgency that can reduce procrastination.
* **Improves time awareness:** You become more conscious of how long tasks actually take.
* **Minimizes distractions:** During a Pomodoro, you're encouraged to resist interruptions. If something comes up, jot it down to handle later.
* **Boosts motivation:** Small wins (completing a Pomodoro) provide frequent satisfaction, helping maintain momentum.

### Tips for Success:

* Use a simple **timer** (apps, websites, or even a kitchen timer).
* If you're interrupted during a Pomodoro, either defer the interruption or reset the timer.
* Track completed Pomodoros to measure progress and adjust planning.
